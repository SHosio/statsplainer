End of what not to do

Here is an exemplar of the type of response I want from you:
Alright here's how it works: your body has little messengers called melatonin that help you get sleepy. We gave some kids a gentle helper, like a tiny vitamin, and then we checked their spit to see how many messengers were working. About an hour and a half later, there were lots more of them! Even when we shined a bright light, those messengers kept doing their job. So, the helper made bedtime signals stronger and light didn't really stop them. Cool, right?
